# N8N Node Mapping Project - Continuation Instructions

## Current Status
- **Gmail**: âœ… COMPLETED (all 5 categories processed)
- **Microsoft Outlook**: ðŸ”„ NEXT NODE (ready to begin processing)
- **Progress**: 1/180 nodes completed (0.6%)

## Project Overview
Systematic processing of 180+ N8N nodes across 5 comprehensive categories:
1. **Credentials** - Authentication and API setup
2. **App-nodes (Actions)** - Available operations and resources
3. **Trigger-nodes** - Event-based automation triggers
4. **Core-nodes** - Essential workflow components
5. **Cluster-nodes** - Advanced/specialized functionality

## Methodology
Process ONE node comprehensively across ALL 5 categories before moving to the next node. This ensures complete coverage and avoids fragmented documentation.

## Technical Implementation
- **Target File**: `MCP-Servers/n8n-mcp-server/src/data/clean-node-catalog.ts`
- **Tracking File**: `MCP-Servers/n8n-mcp-server/n8n-node-master-list.json`
- **Data Source**: Official N8N documentation via web scraping
- **MCP Server**: Oxylabs MCP for systematic web scraping

## Gmail Completion Summary
Gmail has been fully processed with comprehensive data including:
- **Credentials**: Google OAuth2 API setup
- **Resource Operations**: 
  - Draft: Create, Delete, Get, Get Many
  - Label: Create, Delete, Get, Get Many
  - Message: Send, Get, Get Many, Delete, Add/Remove Label, Mark Read/Unread, Reply
  - Thread: Get, Get Many, Delete, Add/Remove Label, Reply, Trash, Untrash
- **Trigger Operations**: Email triggers for automation
- **Core/Cluster**: Verified no additional nodes exist

## Next Node: Microsoft Outlook
Ready to begin comprehensive processing of Microsoft Outlook across all 5 categories.

### Microsoft Outlook Processing Plan:
1. **Credentials Category**
   - Scrape: `https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/credentials/microsoftoutlook/`
   - Document: Authentication setup, API requirements, OAuth configuration

2. **App-nodes (Actions) Category**
   - Scrape: `https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/app-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftoutlook/`
   - Document: All available operations, resources, parameters

3. **Trigger-nodes Category**
   - Scrape: `https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/trigger-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.microsoftoutlooktrigger/`
   - Document: Event triggers, webhook configurations

4. **Core-nodes Category**
   - Search: `https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/` for Outlook-related core nodes
   - Document: Any core functionality related to Outlook

5. **Cluster-nodes Category**
   - Search: `https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/` for Outlook-related cluster nodes
   - Document: Any advanced/specialized Outlook functionality

## Systematic Processing Steps:

### Step 1: Credentials Research
```bash
# Use Oxylabs MCP to scrape credentials documentation
```

### Step 2: App-nodes Research
```bash  
# Use Oxylabs MCP to scrape app-nodes documentation
```

### Step 3: Trigger-nodes Research
```bash
# Use Oxylabs MCP to scrape trigger-nodes documentation
```

### Step 4: Core-nodes Research
```bash
# Search core nodes for Outlook-related functionality
```

### Step 5: Cluster-nodes Research
```bash
# Search cluster nodes for Outlook-related functionality
```

### Step 6: Data Consolidation
After gathering all data, consolidate into comprehensive Microsoft Outlook entry in `clean-node-catalog.ts` following the Gmail example pattern.

## File Structure Context
- **Primary catalog**: `MCP-Servers/n8n-mcp-server/src/data/clean-node-catalog.ts`
- **Node arrays**: COMMUNICATION_NODES (where Outlook should be added)
- **Entry format**: Follow Gmail comprehensive structure with full resource operations

## Expected Outlook Resources
Based on typical email service patterns, expect:
- **Message Operations**: Send, Get, Get Many, Delete, Move, Reply, Forward
- **Folder Operations**: Create, Delete, Get, Get Many, Move
- **Calendar Operations**: Create Event, Get Event, Update Event, Delete Event
- **Contact Operations**: Create, Get, Get Many, Update, Delete
- **Attachment Operations**: Add, Get, Delete

## Progress Tracking
After completing Microsoft Outlook:
1. Update `n8n-node-master-list.json` status to "completed"
2. Set next node (slack) to "in-progress"
3. Update completion percentage to ~1.1%
4. Add completion entry to completion_log

## Key Success Metrics
- âœ… All 5 categories researched and documented
- âœ… Comprehensive resource operations identified
- âœ… Authentication requirements documented
- âœ… Trigger capabilities mapped
- âœ… Core/cluster node verification completed
- âœ… Data successfully consolidated into catalog
- âœ… TypeScript syntax validation passed
- âœ… Progress tracking updated

## Context Continuity
This file ensures seamless continuation of the systematic N8N node mapping project. The next person/context should:
1. Begin with Microsoft Outlook credentials research
2. Follow the 5-category systematic approach
3. Maintain the comprehensive documentation standard established with Gmail
4. Update tracking files upon completion
5. Prepare for transition to the next node (Slack)

---
**Project Goal**: Complete official inventory of all 180+ N8N nodes with comprehensive documentation across all 5 categories, enabling advanced N8N automation and integration capabilities.
