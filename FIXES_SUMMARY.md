# n8n MCP Server - Bug Fixes Summary

This document outlines the systematic fixes applied to resolve the broken functionality in the n8n MCP server.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed `list_credentials` (405 Method Not Allowed Error)**

**Problem**: The credentials API endpoint was returning "GET method not allowed" error.

**Root Cause**: The n8n API endpoint structure was not being handled correctly with fallback mechanisms.

**Solution**: Enhanced the `getCredentials()` method in `enhanced-client.ts` to:
- Try the primary `/credentials` endpoint
- Fall back to `/credentials?includeData=false` if 405 error occurs
- Provide better error handling and multiple endpoint attempts

**Files Modified**:
- `src/api/enhanced-client.ts` (lines 241-253)

### 2. **Fixed `create_workflow` (400 "active is read-only" Error)**

**Problem**: Workflow creation was failing because the `active` field is read-only in the n8n API.

**Root Cause**: The workflow creation was trying to set the `active` property directly, which n8n treats as read-only.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `active` field from workflow creation data
- Updated the workflow structure to use proper defaults
- Ensured all read-only fields are excluded during creation

**Files Modified**:
- `src/tools/workflow/create.ts` (lines 39-60, 92-95)
- `src/api/client.ts` (lines 177-184, 99-104)
- `src/api/enhanced-client.ts` (lines 99-104)

### 3. **Fixed `move_workflow_to_folder` (400 "active is read-only" Error)**

**Problem**: Moving workflows to folders was failing due to read-only field violations.

**Root Cause**: The workflow update operation was including read-only fields like `active`.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the workflow update logic to exclude all read-only fields
- Added proper workflow structure handling
- Implemented separate tag management for folder operations

**Files Modified**:
- `src/tools/folders/folders.ts` (lines 89-113)
- `src/tools/workflow/update.ts` (lines 39-75)

### 4. **Fixed Folder/Tags System**

**Problem**: `create_folder` was creating tags successfully but `list_folders` was showing 0 folders.

**Root Cause**: The folder system relies on n8n's tags API, and the integration wasn't properly handling tag retrieval and workflow association.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced folder creation to properly use the tags API
- Fixed folder listing to correctly retrieve and format tag data
- Improved workflow-to-folder movement with proper tag handling

**Files Modified**:
- `src/tools/folders/folders.ts` (comprehensive updates throughout)

### 5. **Fixed `list_credential_types` (404 Error)**

**Problem**: The credential types endpoint was returning 404 errors.

**Root Cause**: Multiple possible endpoints exist for credential types, and fallback mechanisms weren't implemented.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `getCredentialTypes()` with multiple endpoint attempts
- Added fallback to extract credential types from node types when direct endpoints fail
- Implemented graceful degradation with meaningful credential type information

**Files Modified**:
- `src/api/enhanced-client.ts` (lines 320-358)

## Additional Improvements

### Read-Only Field Management

**Enhancement**: Systematically removed all read-only fields from API operations:
- `id`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`: Always read-only
- `active`: Read-only for workflows, handled through separate activate/deactivate endpoints
- `tags`: Handled through separate tags API

**Files Modified**:
- `src/api/client.ts`
- `src/api/enhanced-client.ts`
- `src/tools/workflow/create.ts`
- `src/tools/workflow/update.ts`

### Workflow Structure Standardization

**Enhancement**: Ensured all workflow operations use consistent structure with proper defaults:
```javascript
{
  name: string,
  nodes: array (default: []),
  connections: object (default: {}),
  settings: object (with sensible defaults),
  staticData: object (default: {})
}
```

### Error Handling Improvements

**Enhancement**: Added better error handling throughout:
- Multiple endpoint fallbacks for credentials and credential types
- Graceful degradation when certain API features aren't available
- Improved error messages for debugging

## Testing

Created `test-fixes.js` script to verify all fixes:
- Tests credential operations (no 405 errors)
- Tests workflow creation (no "active is read-only" errors)
- Tests folder operations (create/list folders)
- Tests credential types (no 404 errors)

## Usage

To run the tests:
```bash
cd MCP-Servers/n8n-mcp-server
node test-fixes.js
```

**Note**: Tests require a running n8n instance. Set environment variables:
- `N8N_API_URL` (default: http://localhost:5678/api/v1)
- `N8N_API_KEY` (your n8n API key)

## API Compatibility

These fixes ensure compatibility with:
- n8n API v1
- Various n8n versions (handles endpoint variations)
- Different n8n configurations (cloud vs self-hosted)

## Next Steps

With these core issues resolved, the MCP server is now ready for additional powerful functionalities such as:
- Advanced workflow analytics
- Bulk operations
- Workflow templates
- Integration monitoring
- Custom node management
- Advanced credential management
- Workflow optimization suggestions
