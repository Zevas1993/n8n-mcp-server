# n8n MCP Server Enhancement Plan

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Limited Workflow Creation Support
- Basic workflow creation without proper node guidance
- No node type discovery or validation
- Poor connection handling between nodes
- Missing workflow templates and patterns

### 2. Missing Critical n8n API Features
- No credentials management
- No variables/environment variables support
- No node type discovery
- Limited execution control (no start/stop/retry)
- No workflow import/export capabilities
- No tags management

### 3. Poor AI Agent Experience
- No guidance on node connection patterns
- No validation of workflow structure
- No error recovery suggestions
- Limited context about n8n capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Expand API Client**: Add missing n8n API endpoints
2. **Create Helper Systems**: Node discovery, validation, templates
3. **Enhance Tools**: More comprehensive and intelligent tools
4. **Improve Resources**: Better context and state information
5. **Add AI-Friendly Features**: Guidance, validation, suggestions

## Success Metrics

- AI agents can successfully create complex workflows
- Proper node connections are made automatically
- Common workflow patterns are easily accessible
- Error rates in workflow creation are minimized
- Full n8n API functionality is available through MCP
